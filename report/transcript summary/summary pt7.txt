In this detailed tutorial, the presenter embarks on the complex journey of booting a custom kernel in Exception Level 1 (EL1) on the ARMv8 architecture, specifically targeting the Raspberry Pi platform. This step is crucial for bare-metal programming enthusiasts aiming to harness the full capabilities of the hardware, given that EL1 is the standard operating level for most operating systems, providing a balanced level of system resource access and security.

The tutorial begins with a recommendation to download the ARMv8 Reference Manual, a vital resource for understanding the intricate details of the ARM architecture. This document serves as a guide through the process, underlining the importance of having authoritative reference material at hand when working closely with hardware.

To achieve the goal of booting into EL1, the tutorial transitions into a hands-on coding session, focusing on the boot.s assembly file. This file is crucial for initializing the system correctly and setting the appropriate exception level. The presenter methodically introduces a series of steps, starting with disabling the Memory Management Unit (MMU) to prevent any unintended interactions during the boot process. This involves manipulating special registers like SCTLR_EL1, highlighting the direct manipulation of hardware registers characteristic of bare-metal programming.

The creation of a sysregs.h header file is introduced to manage the system register configurations efficiently. This file encapsulates various system settings, including the MMU's state, further abstracting the complexity involved in configuring the system's initial state. The tutorial underscores the use of bitwise operations and special ARM instructions to modify these registers, showcasing the low-level programming skills necessary for this type of development.

A significant portion of the video is dedicated to explaining the transition from a higher exception level (EL3) to the target EL1. This process involves setting up various control registers, such as HCR_EL2 and SCR_EL3, to configure the system's operation mode and security settings. Each step is meticulously explained, with references to the ARMv8 manual for viewers to understand the rationale behind each configuration.

The tutorial does not shy away from addressing common pitfalls and debugging challenges encountered during this process. The presenter navigates through syntax errors and logical missteps, providing a realistic view of the development cycle, including troubleshooting and validation. This approach not only educates viewers on the technical steps required to achieve EL1 booting but also instills a sense of perseverance and problem-solving skills critical in the field of system programming.

As the session concludes with the system successfully booting in EL1, the tutorial transitions from the theoretical groundwork laid by the ARMv8 manual to the practical application of these principles in a real-world scenario. The successful boot into EL1 marks a significant milestone in the bare-metal development project, setting the stage for further exploration of the Raspberry Pi's capabilities, such as initializing interrupt vectors and other system functionalities.

This tutorial serves as a comprehensive guide for developers looking to deepen their understanding of the ARM architecture and the Raspberry Pi platform. By bridging the gap between hardware documentation and practical application, the presenter effectively demystifies the complexities of booting into EL1, empowering viewers with the knowledge and confidence to tackle their own bare-metal programming projects.
